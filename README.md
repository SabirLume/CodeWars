This kata is about multiplying a given number by eight if it is an even number and by nine otherwise.

My Experience:



                                        **Count by X**
Create a function with two arguments that will return a list of length (n) with multiples of (x).
Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.
Return the results as an array (or list in Python, Haskell or Elixir).
Examples:
countBy(1,10) === [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
countBy(2,5) === [2,4,6,8,10]
Testing Result with: Testing for result with count_by(13, 8)

My Experience: I had difficulties figuring out what I needed to multiply in order for me to get the x argument
