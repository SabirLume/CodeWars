This kata is about multiplying a given number by eight if it is an even number and by nine otherwise.

My Experience:



                                                **Count by X**
Create a function with two arguments that will return a list of length (n) with multiples of (x).
Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.
Return the results as an array (or list in Python, Haskell or Elixir).
Examples:
countBy(1,10) === [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
countBy(2,5) === [2,4,6,8,10]
Testing Result with: Testing for result with count_by(13, 8)

My Experience: I had difficulties figuring out what I needed to multiply in order for me to get the x argument


                                                **String Repeat**
Write a function called repeatStr which repeats the given 
string string exactly n times.
repeatStr(6, "I") // "IIIIII"
repeatStr(5, "Hello") // "HelloHelloHelloHelloHello"

My Experience: I had difficulties understanding how to make the string repeat iself. Realized multiplying a number by a string will only get you 'NaN' because multiplying in JS only works with integers

                                        **Convert a String Into a Number**
                                        
We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?


My Experience: I had to find a method to convert the string into numbers (parseInt).

                                        **Keep Up the Hoop**
Alex just got a new hula hoop, he loves it but feels discouraged because his little brother is better than him

Write a program where Alex can input (n) how many times the hoop goes round and it will return him an encouraging message :)

If Alex gets 10 or more hoops, return the string "Great, now move on to tricks".

If he doesn't get 10 hoops, return the string "Keep at it until you get it".       

My Experience: I found this challenge fairly easy. I did come run into some syntax problem when making my conditional. Something I need to work on. I put a itteration when I did not need one.
